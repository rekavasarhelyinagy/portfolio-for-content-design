              This is individual project is a perfume branding. 
              The slogan seen on the poster below "Let the light into your life" refers to the enlightened emotions the brand aims to evoke in customers.<br/> 
              The idea behind placing the logo not on top of a sticker like most the perfumes, but engraving it on the transparent surface is to allow the light shine through the glass, creating magical colors and heart-warming, romantic, delightful emotions. This picture also appear on the product poster below, where the perfume is presented with a rising sun in the background, which gives the glass beautyful light colours.<br/> 
              The Brand Name Lumiere Essence comes from French, which means the essence of light. <br/>

            </div>
            <p>
              The Logo also represents this idea with a minimalistic, elegant symbol of the sun. The primary logo on the left includes the brand name as well, the secondary logo on the right is applied in small surfaces using only the sun symbol.<br/>
              The Typography, Gustatory Delight Regular mirrors the elegantly feminine side of the product. <br/>

              A short trailer was also made for the product, which aims to create the above explained enlightened emotions the brand want to achieve.

              This picture below is just a small insight behind the scenes. The method of creating the background was inspired by a new method in the film industry, where huge LED screens are used behind the actors instead of green screens, which makes the scene more realistic and easier to create. Being excited from this solution, I applied the process in small, using my laptop as a LED screen behind the small mockup bottle.
